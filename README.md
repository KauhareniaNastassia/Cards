### When you see the pack table, you can select one for training and click the icon for training. You can also create a pack yourself by filling it with cards (text or pictures). You can change the theme in the app, search for the right packs by name in the search, filter the packs by the number of cards, change background theme and etc.

### You can also view your pack by clicking on its name. Inside it is a menu for editing and learning. If the pack was created by another user, you cannot edit it, only training.

### The learning logic is implemented so that you receive more often those questions, that you did not know the answers to during the previous passage of the pack with cards.
